1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React introduces a diffing algorithm that compares the DOM to itself to see what has changed, allowing for client-side single page applications to become more performant than the classic server driven applications. Think Facebook.

2. Describe component state.

Component state allows the application to store and set information in a temporary buffer, much like RAM on a PC. 
///

3. Describe props.

Props allow the code to easily pass information from one component to another.

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. Fetching data from an API, timers, logging, and manually manipulating the DOM are all examples of side effects.
